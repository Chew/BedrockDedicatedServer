# BedrockDedicatedServer

This repository tracks chanegs and differences in the BedrockDedicatedServer ZIP files.

This repository does NOT include the `bedrock_server` file used to run the server, as it is too large and does not need to be tracked (and binary file changes aren't tracked to begin with).

This also does not include the 1GB debug file one of the versions had. Why? Accident? Who knows.
